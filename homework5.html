		<h1>Homework 5 - Assessing expressiveness</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>In <a href="homework4.html">homework 4</a>, you worked hard to enumerate the limitations of a user interface technology. This week, I want you to leverage that knowledge of limitations to assess the <em>expressive limits</em> of the same technology. To find the expressive limits of an interface, you must essentially generate as many ideas about how the interface technology might be used, trying to find the boundaries of what can and cannot be done with it.</p>
		
		<p>To illustrate, consider Apple's collection of FaceID technologies, which I discussed in the last homework. To find it's expressive limits, I need to brainstorm as many possible ideas within the technology's limitations. The ideas don't have to be good, they just have to be feasible within the limits of the technology. Here I go!</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>A game of tag, where tagging is recognizing someone's face</li>
			<li>Your phone watches you while you drive, and wakes you up with a loud sound if it looks like you're sleeping.</li>
			<li>An avatar designer based on the geometry of your face.</li>
			<li>A video chat filter that turns you into a floating talking head</li>
			<li>A self-tracking obesity monitor based on fat deposits</li>
			<li>An anti-selfie camera app that always replaces your face with creepy, unidentifiable masks</li>
			<li>A beautifying camera app that identifies asymmetries in facial geometry and corrects them</li>
			<li>An augmented reality app that applies your facial geometry to objects in a room, making everything look like you</li>
			<li>Improved face detection in photo libraries</li>
			<li>A 3D painting app where your face is the brush and your expression is the palette</li>
			<li>A rhythm game requiring you to open and close your eyes and mouth on beat</li>
			<li>A social media lookalike finder based on facial structure</li>
			<li>An intruder detector that alarms when it doesn't recognize a family face</li>
			<li>A privacy testing tool that allows you develop FaceID proof masks and hats</li>
			<li>A non-verbal communication training tool, helping you improve the clarity of emotions to others</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Phew! That was 15 ideas in 15 minutes.</p>
		
		<h2>Your task</h2>
		
		<p>Your task is to take the interface technology you've been analyzing and ideate at least 15 distinct ways of using it to create new experiences. You can share ideas that already exist in the world; you don't have to be the one with the idea yourself. But that can be more fun.</p>
		
		<p>Your submission should just be a single sentence describing the technology and then a bulleted list of the 15 ideas.</p>
		
		<h2>Grading</h2>
		
		<p>This homework is worth 5 points. You get 0.33 points for each distinct and plausibly feasible idea.</p>
