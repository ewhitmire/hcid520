					<p>Whether you're a software designer, engineer, or user experience researcher, understanding what user interfaces are, how they're built, and what kinds of interfaces can exist is a critical literacy for collaboration and creativity. After all, user interfaces are a medium, like any other: painters need to understand paint, writers need to understand words, and anyone involved in designing, building, or understanding interactions with software needs to understand user interfaces.</p>

					<p>By end of the course you will:</p>
										
					<ul>
						<li>Be able to describe all major user interface concepts and paradigms</li>
						<li>Use a theory of user interfaces to describe, analyze, and critique user interface technology</li>
						<li>Describe major classes of inventions in user interface software and technology</li>
						<li>Identify open questions in user interface technology</li>
						<li>Conducted detailed assessments of product opportunities for user interface innovations</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Workload</h2>
					
					<p>Your weeks look like this:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Monday: Come to class ready for discussion and activity</li>
						<li>Tuesday: Do your Wednesday reading</li>
						<li>Wednesday: Come to class ready for discussion and activity</li>
						<li>Thursday-Sunday: Do your Monday reading, then do your homework</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Stay on top of reading so you have time to focus on homework.</p>
					
					<!-- QUARTERLY -->
					<h2>Office Hours</h2>
					
					<p>I'm available to talk about jobs, careers, graduate school, research, class, and anything else. My office hours are always posted on <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/">the top of my faculty website</a>. To guarantee I'll be around, write me in advance to secure a time.</p>

					<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
	
					<p>There are two types of readings in this class. The first are <strong>required readings</strong> from the book I wrote, <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/uist/">User Interface Software and Technology</a>. When you read this, you'll need to come to class ready to demonstrate your knowledge of everything in the chapter, including any video under 10 minutes (longer videos are there for deeper learning). We'll start class by discussing any points of confusion in the chapter. Then, I'll give a quiz with a single question and if you answer it correctly, you'll get full credit. After the quiz, we'll discuss the right answer. <strong>If you miss class</strong>, you can makeup the missed quiz credit by writing me an email with a critique of the chapter containing at least two ideas for improvements.</p>

					<p>The second type of reading is <strong>selected reading</strong>. You can choose any of the articles cited in the "Further reading" section of a chapter. Pick based on interest, then read the paper (or if it's a book, a chapter of the book), and distill the key insights of the paper into three sentences:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>Sentence 1: What the paper explained</li>
						<li>Sentence 2: A description of an idea the paper shared and how it changed your thinking.</li>
						<li>Sentence 3: What impact you believe this insight may have on user interfaces in the future.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>Each submission should include the cited paper and then three sentences like this:</p>
					
					<blockquote>
						This paper described a new pointing device called a "mouse." I found the idea of mapping the motion of an object on two axes to a virtual coordinate system to be intriguingly general. I predict we'll see a diversity of mouse shapes to fit the diversity of hands and abilities.
					</blockquote>

					<p>For selected readings, you'll get 0.5 points for each of the three sentences, and anywhere from 0 to 0.5 points based on the <em>pithiness</em> of your writing (meaning it should be concise and forcefully expressive). The example above is pithy enough for full credit.</p>

					<h2 id="homework">Homeworks</h2>
					
					<p>Whereas the readings in the course will give you a strong conceptual foundation for user interfaces, the homeworks will help you practice two key skills in interaction design, UX research, and front-end engineering: <em>analyzing and communicating design opportunities</em>. You'll do this over the course of several homeworks:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Homework 1 (5 points): <a href="homework1.html">Discovering discoveries</a></li>
						<li>Homework 2 (5 points): <a href="homework2.html">Extracting insights</a></li>
						<li>Homework 3 (5 points): <a href="homework3.html">Analyzing interactions</a></li>
						<li>Homework 4 (5 points): <a href="homework4.html">Assessing maturity</a></li>
						<li>Homework 5 (5 points): <a href="homework5.html">Assessing expressiveness</a></li>
						<li>Homework 6 (5 points): Assessing ownership</li>
						<li>Homework 7 (22 points): Envisioning opportunity</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>By the end of the course, you'll have deeply analyzed an user interface innovation for product viability.</p>
	
					<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
	
					<p>There are <b>100 points</b> you can earn in this class:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Required reading quizzes (<strong>16 points</strong>)</li>
						<li>Selected reading summary (<strong>32 points</strong>)</li>
						<li>Homework (<strong>52 points</strong>): due each Monday before class</li>
						
					</ul>

					<p>After rounding your points to the nearest whole number, I'll map your 100 points to a 4.0 scale using the table below.</p>
					
					<table class="table table-striped">
						<tr><td>&ge;95</td><td>4.0</td><td>&ge;88</td><td>3.3</td><td>&ge;81</td><td>2.6</td><td>&ge;74</td><td>1.9</td><td>&ge;67</td><td>1.2</td></tr>
						<tr><td>&ge;94</td><td>3.9</td><td>&ge;87</td><td>3.2</td><td>&ge;80</td><td>2.5</td><td>&ge;73</td><td>1.8</td><td>&ge;66</td><td>1.1</td></tr>
						<tr><td>&ge;93</td><td>3.8</td><td>&ge;86</td><td>3.1</td><td>&ge;79</td><td>2.4</td><td>&ge;72</td><td>1.7</td><td>&ge;65</td><td>1.0</td></tr>
						<tr><td>&ge;92</td><td>3.7</td><td>&ge;85</td><td>3.0</td><td>&ge;78</td><td>2.3</td><td>&ge;71</td><td>1.6</td><td>&ge;64</td><td>0.9</td></tr>
						<tr><td>&ge;91</td><td>3.6</td><td>&ge;84</td><td>2.9</td><td>&ge;77</td><td>2.2</td><td>&ge;70</td><td>1.5</td><td>&ge;63</td><td>0.8</td></tr>
						<tr><td>&ge;90</td><td>3.5</td><td>&ge;83</td><td>2.8</td><td>&ge;76</td><td>2.1</td><td>&ge;69</td><td>1.4</td><td>&ge;62</td><td>0.7</td></tr>
						<tr><td>&ge;89</td><td>3.4</td><td>&ge;82</td><td>2.7</td><td>&ge;75</td><td>2.0</td><td>&ge;68</td><td>1.3</td><td>&le;61</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
					</table>					

					<p>Late work receives no credit unless you can provide a note from a health care professional documenting the reason for your absence. If you miss a reading quiz due to sickness, you can make up the quiz credit by sending a critique of the reading to me within a week of the due date that reports at least three improvements to the content, including high level issues such as topics that should be discussed or points you think are wrong, to low-level issues including spelling, grammar, or clarity.</p>

					<p>If you're not happy with a reading or homework grade, you can read our feedback and resubmit it for a regrade at any time. We'll give you up to 50% of the credit you lost on your last submission. Our goal is for you to learn the material. This allows you to correct whatever misconception you had and have that improved knowledge reflected in your grade.</p>
